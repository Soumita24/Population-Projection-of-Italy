#  Population Projection of Italy 
–	Developed a simple mathematical approach to predict the population of Italy for the year  2021, without attempting any justification of particular assumptions about fertility, mortality, and migration.
–	Focused on fitting an appropriate model using the past census years (1861-2011) data  on  a population to infer about the future demographic trends of Italy, using two methods: 1.  Modeling using total population data, 2. Modeling using male and female population data separately, and then combining it to get the total count.
–	Used the Linear, Exponential, Quadratic, Logistic (Pearl-Reed Logistic) Curves for assessing the population’s status.
